      With over 26 years of experience building and managing libraries from the ground up, 
      I bring a passion for creating spaces where knowledge is easy to find and a joy to explore. 
      From The Royal Colosseum University to Sceptre College, Beaconhouse School, British Overseas School, 
      and Aisha Bawany Girls’ Secondary School, I have transformed empty rooms into vibrant, well-organized 
      libraries aligned with HEC standards.

      Skilled in library management systems including LIMS, PRIMASOFT, BEAMS, KOHA, and Web Dewey, 
      I combine technical expertise with a personal touch—whether guiding a student to the perfect 
      resource or curating collections that inspire. I believe a library should feel welcoming, 
      organized, and alive, and I take pride in making that happen every day.
